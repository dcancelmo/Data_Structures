Output file

When ‘GraphTest.java’ is executed, these files print the following to the terminal:

Graph 9.10 is directed: true
	has 7 vertices.
	has 12 edges.
Graph 9.10 has node 5 directing to node 7: true
Graph 9.10 has node 7 directing to node 5: false
Adjacency Array shown below:
0: 1 3 -1 
1: 3 4 -1 
2: 0 -1 
3: 2 4 5 6 -1 
4: 6 -1 
5: 2 -1 
6: 5 -1 
Edge from 4 to 6 was not in the graph, no change made.
Edge from node5 to node7 has been deleted.

Graph 9.62 is directed: false
	has 5 vertices.
	has 7 edges.
Graph 9.62 has node A (0) directing to node D (3): true
Graph 9.62 has node E (4) directing to node D (3): false
Adjacency Array shown below:

1: 0 2 3 -1 
2: 1 3 4 -1 
3: 0 1 2 -1
