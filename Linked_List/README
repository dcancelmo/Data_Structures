This lab is on linked lists. It is Lab 4 for CSC 172 with Professor Pawlicki.
'MyNode.java' creates a node for a list. 
'SimpleLinkedList.java' is an interface that contains the method for a linked list and is implemented by 'ListClass.java'.
'ListClass.java' contains the code for the necessary functions of a list implemented form the 'SimpleLinkedList.java' interface.
'LinkedListTest.java' tests each of the methods from 'ListClass.java'.
The methods created in 'ListClass.java' are insert, delete, contains, lookup, isEmpty, and printList. 
The insert method will only insert if the list does not already contain that entry.
The expected runtime of insert is 1. The expected runtime of printList is n.


Included are four java source files 'ListClass.java', 'SimpleLinkedList.java', 'MyNode.java', and 'LinkedListTest.java' already described above. 
In addition there is a text file titled 'OUTPUT.txt' that shows what is printed to the console when the programs are ran.
