This lab is on queues. It is Lab 7 for CSC 172 with Professor Pawlicki.
‘MyQueue.java' contains the code for the necessary functions of a queue implemented from the ‘Queue.java’ interface.
‘Queue.java’ is an interface that contains the methods for a queue and is implemented by ‘MyQueue.java'.
‘MyQueueTest.java' tests each of the methods from ‘MyQueue.java'.

'MyDoubleNode.java' creates a doubly linked node for a list. 
'DoublyLinkedList.java' is an interface that contains the method for a doubly linked list and is implemented by 'DoublyList.java'.
'DoublyClass.java' contains the code for the necessary methods of a list implemented from the 'DoublyLinkedList.java' interface.
'DoublyLinkedListTest.java' tests each of the methods from 'ListClass.java'.
The methods created in 'ListClass.java' are insert, delete, contains, lookup, isEmpty, printList, and printListRev. 
The insert method will only insert if the list does not already contain that entry.


Included are six java source files ‘DoublyClass.java', ‘DoublyLinkedList.java', and ’MyDoubleNode.java' already described above are originally from Lab 4 but have been modified to meet the requirements of this lab. ‘Queue.java’, ‘MyQueue.java’, and ‘MyQueueTest.java’ are also included already described above.
In addition there is a text file titled 'OUTPUT.txt' that shows what is printed to the console when the programs are ran.
