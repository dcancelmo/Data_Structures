This lab is on Binary Search Trees (BST). It is Lab 8 for CSC 172 with Professor Pawlicki.
'MyTreeNode.java' creates a node for a BST. 
‘BST.java' is an interface that contains the method for a BST and is implemented by ‘BinaryTree.java'.
‘BinaryTree.java' contains the code for the necessary functions of a list implemented from the ‘BST.java' interface.
‘BinaryTreeTest.java' tests each of the methods from ‘BinaryTree.java'.
The methods created in ‘BinaryTree.java' are insert, delete, lookup, printPreOrder, printInOrder, and printPostOrder. 
The insert method will only insert if the BST does not already contain that entry.


Included are four java source files ‘BinaryTree.java', ‘BST.java', 'MyTreeNode.java', and ‘BinaryTreeTest.java' already described above. 
In addition there is a text file titled 'OUTPUT.txt' that shows what is printed to the console when the programs are ran.
