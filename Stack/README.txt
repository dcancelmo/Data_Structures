I apologize for the improper formatting on my previous weeks README and OUTPUT. I submitted them before I received the grade and feedback for the previous weeks Labs with your comments regarding the .txt files.


This lab is on Stacks. It is Lab 6 for CSC 172 with Professor Pawlicki.
‘MyStack.java' contains the code for the necessary functions of a stack implemented from the ‘Stack.java' interface.
'Stacks.java' is an interface that contains the methods for a stack and is implemented by ‘MyStack.java'.
‘MyStackTest.java' tests each of the methods from 'ListClass.java'.

'MyNode.java' creates a node for a list. 
'SimpleLinkedList.java' is an interface that contains the method for a linked list and is implemented by 'ListClass.java'.
'ListClass.java' contains the code for the necessary functions of a list implemented form the 'SimpleLinkedList.java' interface.
The methods created in 'ListClass.java' are insert, delete, contains, lookup, isEmpty, and printList. 
The insert method will only insert if the list does not already contain that entry.
The expected runtime of insert is 1. The expected runtime of printList is n.


Included are six java source files 'ListClass.java', 'SimpleLinkedList.java', and ’MyNode.java' already described above are originally from Lab 4 but have been modified to meet the requirements of this lab. ‘Stack.java’, ‘MyStack.java’, and ‘MyStackTest.java’ are also included already described above.
In addition there is a text file titled 'OUTPUT.txt' that shows what is printed to the console when the programs are ran.
