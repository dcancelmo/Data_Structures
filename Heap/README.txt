This lab is on heaps. It is Lab 9 for CSC 172 with Professor Pawlicki.
‘Heap.java' is an interface that contains the methods for a Heap and is implemented by ‘MyHeap.java'.
‘MyHeap.java' contains the code for the necessary functions of a list implemented from the ‘Heap.java’ interface.
‘HeapTest.java' tests each of the methods from ‘MyHeap.java'. It creates three instances of MyHeap in order to fully test it.
MyHeap has a constructor that accepts nothing, accepts an integer for the capacity, and that accepts an array to be turned into a heap.
The methods created in ‘MyHeap.java' are insert, bubbleUp, resize, printHeap, isEmpty, size, deleteMin, bubbleDown, and heapify.


Included are three java source files ‘MyHeap.java', ‘Heap.java', and ‘HeapTest.java' already described above. 
In addition there is a text file titled 'OUTPUT.txt' that shows what is printed to the console when the programs are ran.
