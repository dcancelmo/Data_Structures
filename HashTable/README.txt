This lab is on Hash Tables. It is Lab 12 for CSC 172 with Professor Pawlicki.
‘MyHashTable.java' contains the code for the require functions of a hash table. This includes: constructors, insert, rehash, print, a hash method, and getters for capacity, unique items, and load factor.
‘HashIpsum.java’ tests all of the methods from ‘MyHashTable.java’. It does this by using ‘Lorem_ipsum.txt’ to read in and insert into a hash table randomized text.
‘HashNameTest.java' tests all of the methods from ‘MyHashTable.java'. It does this by adding a series of names to the table, forcing it to rehash several times, printing, and finding the capacity, unique items, and load factor. ‘HashNameTest.java’ was not required by the assignment but was created for testing during development and so it is included here.


Included are three java source files ‘MyHashTable.java', ‘HashNameTest.java', and ‘HashIpsumTest.java' already described above. 
There is a .txt file named ‘Lorem_ipsum.txt’ that contains the text used to test in ‘HashIpsumTest.txt’.
In addition there is a text file titled 'OUTPUT.txt' that shows what is printed to the console when “HashIpsumTest.java” is ran.
